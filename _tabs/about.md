## Hello, I'm Fadhil!


I am a passionate individual who loves both math and computers. The intersection of these two fields has always fascinated me and led me to specialize in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Currently in my fourth year of pursuing a BTech degree in Computer Science Engineering, I am driven by a deep curiosity to explore the potential of intelligent systems and cutting-edge technologies.

### Education

I am currently pursuing my undergraduate studies in Computer Science Engineering with a specialization in AI and ML. Throughout my academic journey, I have been captivated by the beauty and power of mathematics, which serves as the foundation for many concepts in computer science and machine learning.

### Skills

Drawing from my love for math and computers, I have developed proficiency in several key technologies and frameworks:

- **Scikit-learn**: I have hands-on experience in using scikit-learn, a powerful machine learning library in Python, leveraging mathematical algorithms for tasks such as classification, regression, and clustering.

- **PyTorch**: I am well-versed in PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework that combines the elegance of mathematics with the flexibility of programming. With PyTorch, I have developed neural networks for tasks like image classification and natural language processing.

- **TensorFlow**: I possess a strong understanding of TensorFlow, another widely-used deep learning framework. Its blend of mathematical operations and computational graph-based approach has allowed me to build and train complex deep neural networks.

- **FastAI**: I have honed my skills in FastAI, a high-level deep learning library built on top of PyTorch. The library's focus on simplicity and ease-of-use, along with its mathematical foundations, has enabled me to develop state-of-the-art models and solve challenging machine learning problems.

### Linux Enthusiast

Apart from my love for mathematics and computers, I am an avid Linux enthusiast. I thoroughly enjoy tinkering with Linux systems, exploring their inner workings, and customizing them to suit my needs. Currently, my daily drivers are Pop!_OS and Arch Linux, both of which offer a powerful and flexible environment for my work and experimentation.

### Personal Portfolio
