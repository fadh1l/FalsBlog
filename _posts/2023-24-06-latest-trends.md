# The State of Programming: Degrees, Salaries, and Technologies

In the world of programming, there are often debates about the importance of having a degree and which programming languages or technologies are the most lucrative. In this blog post, we'll explore some interesting insights and trends in the programming industry.

## Do You Really Need a Degree?

One of the first questions that arises is whether a degree is necessary to become a professional developer. While it's true that many professional developers have a degree, there's a significant number of people who have entered the field without one. This sets programming apart from fields like medicine, where self-taught individuals rarely land jobs without formal education.

## The Impact of Programming Language Choice on Salary

Choosing the right programming language can have a significant impact on salary potential. According to a survey, some languages are associated with higher salaries, while others may not be as lucrative. For example:

- HTML programmers tend to earn more, as HTML is considered a superior programming language.
- Zig, a modern low-level language, is at the top of the salary tier. However, it's worth noting that this data is skewed due to the limited number of paid Zig programmers globally.
- Ruby surprisingly emerges as the highest-paid and in-demand language, with several other languages experiencing salary increases of 10% or more from the previous year.

However, not all languages have experienced salary growth. Rust, a popular language, has seen a decline of $35 in average salary. It's essential to stay updated on language trends and market demand.

## Admired and Desired Languages and Technologies

Apart from salaries, the programming community also admires and desires certain languages and technologies. Here are some notable findings:

- Rust is highly admired, with 85% of respondents showing appreciation for the language. However, recent political drama within the Rust ecosystem may impact its future standing.
- Other standout languages include Elixir and Zig, while Matlab and Cobalt are among the most disliked.
- Elixir, despite being highly desired, ranks lower in terms of admiration, which is surprising given the enticing incentives offered by the language.
- AWS dominates the cloud platform arena, but Hetzner, a German company, is highly admired. On the other hand, Heroku has lost favor among developers.
- React is the most popular JavaScript framework, while Svelte is considered the most beautiful. Newer frameworks like Quick and Solid are also gaining admiration.
- In full-stack meta frameworks, Next.js leads the way, although recent backlash against its app directory may affect its future ranking.
- Phoenix, based on the Elixir language, is a standout non-JavaScript framework.
- Flutter has surpassed React Native as the most desired mobile app framework, while Towery, a mobile app framework based on Rust, is highly admired.

## Other Insights and Trends

Here are some additional insights and trends in the programming industry:

- Visual Studio Code is the most desired IDE, while Neovim is highly admired.
- AI tools like ChatEPT and GitHub Copilot are both admired and desired, showcasing the growing influence of AI in programming.
- Surprisingly, around 30% of developers have no plans to utilize AI tools.
- Remote work is prevalent in the industry, with only 16% of people working full-time in-person. Most developers are either remote or hybrid remote.
- Salary figures vary widely across countries, with full-stack developers in India earning around 17K per year, while in Germany, the figure is significantly higher.

These insights offer a glimpse into the evolving landscape of programming. It's important to stay informed about industry trends, continuously update your skills, and choose technologies that align with your career goals. Happy coding!
