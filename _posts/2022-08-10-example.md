## Why zathura?

![Terminal showing zathura in text](https://github.com/fadh1l/TheBlog/blob/main/_posts/assets/zathura0.png "Zathura - a document viewer")
* It all started when I started to search around for a pdf viewer that was lightweight, had zero bloat and was blazing fast.
* I found zathura, and it was the first one I really liked.
* I also have a crippling Vim addiction, and I wanted to see if I could get away with it.

## Features


- It plays very nicely with titling and it looks great due to the fact that the whole thing is borderless and minimal.
- It supports a variety of file types, including pdf, djvu, eps, and more.
- It has a load of keybindings built in, eg:
  - `j` - scroll down
  - `k` - scroll up
  - `h` - scroll left
  - `l` - scroll right
  - `gg` - go to top
  - `G` - go to bottom
  - `q` - quit
  - `r` - reload
  - `R` - nightmode (yes, heard that right)
  - `o` - open file
  - `a` - fit page to screen
  - `s` - fit page to screen width
  - `d` - show dual pages
- This is just some of the most commonly used ones, but there are many more.
